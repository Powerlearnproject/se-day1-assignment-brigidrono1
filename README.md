Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering refers to the application of enineering principles and the knowledge of programming languages to build software solutions foe end users.
Applications of software engineering in the technology industry include:
Design and developing computer games
Developing applications for businesses
Developing systems that control networks


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Cloud Computing(2000s-Present)
The widespread adoption of cloud computing platforms, enabling on demand access to computing resources and facilitating scalable software development
Rapid Prototyping(1980s)
The emergence of rapid prototyping tools allowing developers to quickly create working models of software to gather early user feedback and refine requirements
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML)(Present)
Increased integration of AI and ML techniques into software development ,leading to more intelligent and adaptive applications


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
The Phases of Software Development Life Cycle(SDLC) include:
Planning:
This phase involves defining the project scope ,goals ,timeline, budget and team structure

Requirement Analysis:
This phase involves gathering detailed user needs and translating them in to functional specifications for the software

Design:
This phase involves creating a blue print for the software ,outlining system architecture, user interfaces, and data base design

Implementation(Coding):
This involves writing the actual code for the software based on the design specifications

Testing:
This involves thorough evaluation of the software to identify and fix bugs ,ensuring it meets functional and non -functional requirements.

Deployment:
This involves distributing the completed software to the production environment making it accessible to the users

Maintenance:
This refers to ongoing support after deployment ,including bug fixes, updates, and enhancements to address issues and adapt to changing needs




Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is a linear sequential project management approach with distinct phases ,While the Agile methodology is an iterative and flexible method that allows for continuous adaptation and customer feedback throughout the development process.This therefore makes Waterfall ideal for projects with well defined requirements and strict deadlines ,while Agile is better suited for complex projects with uncertain needs or frequent changes.
An example of a scenario where Waterfall would be in Embedded systems Development when developing firmware for a washing machine once the software is installed in the hardware, changing requirements would be costly and impractical.
A scenario where Agile methodology is used would be in Mobile App development where during development of for example a new social media app since user preferences and market trends change rapidly ,Agile allows continuous updates based on user feedback


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
